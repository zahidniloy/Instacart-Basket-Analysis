Instacart-Basket-Analysis
This project involved leveraging Python to process and analyze multiple datasets from Instacart, culminating in a comprehensive report that outlined the analytical methodology, key findings, and strategic recommendations aligned with business objectives. The analysis incorporated advanced data manipulation techniques and statistical methods to derive actionable insights.
Objective
The project focused on Instacart, an online grocery platform, aiming to identify patterns in sales data through exploratory analysis to enhance customer segmentation strategies. By systematically evaluating transactional behaviors and demographic variables, the analysis provided data-driven recommendations to optimize marketing efforts and operational efficiency.
Key Questions
•	Peak Order Times: Identified the busiest days and hours for orders to optimize ad scheduling during low-traffic periods.
•	Spending Patterns: Analyzed temporal trends in customer expenditure to inform product-specific promotional strategies.
•	Price Segmentation: Developed simplified price-range categories to streamline targeted marketing initiatives.
•	Product Popularity: Evaluated department-level order frequencies to prioritize high-demand product categories.
•	Customer Behavior Analysis:
1.	Assessed user loyalty metrics to understand retention and repeat purchase dynamics.
2.	Examined ordering habits across loyalty tiers, regions, and demographic profiles (age, family status).
3.	Investigated correlations between customer classifications (income, product preferences) and purchasing behaviors, including order value and frequency.
Data
The analysis utilized structured datasets including orders, order_products_prior, products, customers, and departments. The customer dataset and prices column were integrated to simulate real-world analytical scenarios, aligning with CareerFoundry’s instructional framework.
Tools
Python libraries such as Pandas (data wrangling), NumPy (numerical computations), Seaborn and Matplotlib (visual analytics), and SciPy (statistical modeling) were employed to ensure robust data exploration. Methodical error handling was implemented via the warnings library to maintain code integrity.
Folders
•	Project Management: Documentation including project briefs and data dictionaries.
•	Data: Original and cleaned datasets (not publicly shared due to size constraints).
•	Scripts: Jupyter notebooks detailing data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling workflows.
•	Analysis: Visualizations and intermediate outputs supporting insights.
•	Sent to Client: Final Excel report synthesizing findings for stakeholder review.
Resources
Note: While Instacart’s data is publicly available, the project’s specific business context and objectives were designed by CareerFoundry for educational purposes, emphasizing practical application of analytical techniques in retail environments.
